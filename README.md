# Intelligent-Robotics-Reactive-Behavior
Using the **Robobo** robot, consisting of a mobile platform and a smartphone attached to it, this project develops a **reactive architecture on subsumed behaviors** to perform a task. This task involves **detection of boxes around a map, loading the boxes in a platform and unloading them in their associated deposit zones.** The performance and efficiency of the Robobo following the coded behaviors can be easily tested on the simulation enviroment **RoboboSim**, on the Aruco Boxes map.

More detailed information about implementation decissions, code structure and results obtained is available on the Project Memory file.

Please note that the development of this project was limited to the scope of an academic exercise. As such, the project has not undergone further refinement or optimization beyond this point.
