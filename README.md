# Intelligent-Robotics-Reactive-Behavior

Using the **Robobo** robot, consisting of a mobile platform and a smartphone attached to it, this project develops a **reactive architecture on subsumed behaviors** to perform a task. This task involves **detection of boxes around a map, loading the boxes in a platform and unloading them in their associated deposit zones.** The detection and matching of boxes and containers is supported by **Aruco codes**. All of this is done while tracking the battery charge and stopping any action to look for the re-charging zone before it runs out of battery.

As an intelligent robot, the architecture developed allows the robot to act in its environment and meet its objectives regardless of its initial position or orientation and regardless of whether the positions of some of the objects change, that is, it tolerates changes in the environment.

The performance and efficiency of the Robobo following the coded behaviors can be easily tested on the simulation enviroment **RoboboSim**, on the Aruco Boxes map.

More detailed information about implementation decissions, code structure and results obtained is available on the Project Memory file.

Please note that the development of this project was limited to the scope of an academic exercise. As such, the project has not undergone further refinement or optimization beyond this point.
